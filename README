Notes on parse_twitter_xml.py by Lee Becker
============================================
 I have attached the latest version of my python code.  It has some
 other stuff for parsing the twitter XML, but I believe Mark has a
 better package for that.  The main piece of value is the
 parseCrisisSyntax function, which takes a string representing the
 tweet, and parses the tweakTweet syntax and returns a python dict
 (hash table) of key, value pairs between hashtag and its arguments.

 I may try to clean this up to better normalize some tags, but for now
 I need to run.
